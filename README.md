# Old-Draft-WildHacks-2024
April 6 - April 7, 2024.

RETROSPECT:
- Old version of the battery.html that was used for a project in WildHacks 2024. It is mainly here as a historical version of the actual final draft.
- CSS is drastically different, with some alterations of the rest of HTML and Javascript.
- Partnered with someone else to work on the frontend development, including how to show buttons, having the battery image, and creating the UI to look better.
- Learned parts of CSS, HTML, Javascript, and React in order to work on the frontend.

For a small generalization of the Project: Eco Tally
- Four person team.
- Purpose of the project is to record data of the individual using the product about their waste generation, as well as warning them of any overgeneration.
- Used Kintone as a database and backend.
- Old draft used HTML, CSS, Javascript. The reason behind this being outdated was the conversion to fit the rest of the code in the project. This included the conversion to React.
